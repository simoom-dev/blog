# Behold!

## Current status of the project and development environment

<br>

Now we have the base of our combat system! As you can see in the gif above, the player can shoot, move around and dash. 

This was done based mainly on two Unity tutorials:

* [Tanks tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/tanks-tutorial)
* [Survival Shooter Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter-tutorial)

And all the modelling/animation was done on [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) which integrates seamlessly with Unity. The only catch is that you [must have Blender installed for the integration to work](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-ImportObjectBlender.html). Other than that, just save your files somewhere into your project's ´Assets´ folder and you're done. And every time you update the Blender file, it get automatically reimported. 

So we're going to build the game on top of that.

Project versioning is through git, so we set up a github repository for the team. One good advice for Unity projects on git is to add a .gitignore to avoid pushing useless files to the remote. Luckily there's a collection of gitignores that cover types of project one can't even imagine, including [one for Unity projects](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore). We just added two lines to get rid of Blender's ´.blend1´ backup files:

´´´
*.blend1
*.blend1.meta
´´´

# Game structure

We have been discussing the plot of the game, and it led us to some decisions concerning the general game struture:

<br>
<img src="{{ site.url | append:site.baseurl }}/images/game-sequence.png" width="400px" alt="Level structure">
<br>

The whole idea is that the game consists of a number of **Levels**. Each Level is made up of a network of **Maps**. Maps have some **Events** and **Enemies** to battle. For each level there is one <span style="color:#2c89a0">entry map</span> and one <span style="color:#a02c2c">exit map</span> and those contain the *entry* and *exit events*, respectively.

We thought that to complete a map, the player would take about 2 minutes, so that the game is fast paced. Also, there's no going back on maps, you always have to go forward on the level because, after all, you'll be running from an **Apocalyptic Sandstorm**.

We're a team of 4: 3 developers and a designer. So, for the next week, we divided the tasks in:

* **Combat polishing**
* **Enemy polishing**
* **Creation of first event(s)**
* **Interface creation**

# Our ideas

The project ideas are being gathered in a shared text document of ours. We're thinking about the plot, creatures and characters for the game, and soon thos will begin to appear on our posts. More on that later!
