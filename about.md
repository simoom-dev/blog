# What is Simoom?

 The best one-liner would be: "an arabic roguelike shootâ€™em up whith an isometric camera".

 It's a game aimed to be a fun mashup of many genres and games we played during our lives.

 As of now, there is not much purpose in elaborating anything here, so we encourage you to read our blog updates and ask us questions directly if there are anything you would like to discuss.

# Why it exists?

  We all have been interested in gamedev for a long time. The motivation for this game comes from the "Games and Animation" course we are taking at [UFRJ](http://ufrj.br).

  Our first release is scheduled for the beginning of june.
